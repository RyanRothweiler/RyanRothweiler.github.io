      <h4>Instructions and Details</h4>
<p>This game is much more of a proof of concept as there is no real goal. Players can click on the workers, move them around, and collect resources with them. Once a resource is collected it respawns randomly on the map. This was created as a test to prove SandCat functionality.</p>
